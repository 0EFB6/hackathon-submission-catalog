tagline: >-
  zkDebit is a private payment solution leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)
  to process transactions without exposing sensitive details like card numbers
  or CVVs. Instead, users prove card ownership with a time-limited nonce,
  ensuring privacy and enhanced security for payments.
